# 🛳️ Titanic Predictor

This project trains a machine learning model to predict the chances of survival on the Titanic based on passenger characteristics (age, sex, class, etc.).  

The dataset comes from the classic [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

## ⚙️ Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical data)  
- Feature selection (Age, Sex, Passenger Class, etc.)  
- Model training using scikit-learn  
- Evaluation using accuracy score  
- Exported trained model (JSON / pickle format)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kambains226/Titanic-predictor.git
   cd Titanic-predictor
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    jupyter notebook Titanic.ipynb

import joblib

# Example of loading a model (update file name if JSON/pkl differs)
model = joblib.load("Model/titanic_model.pkl")

# Example passenger: [Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare]
sample = [[3, "male", 22, 1, 0, 7.25]]

prediction = model.predict(sample)
print("Survived" if prediction[0] == 1 else "Did not survive")

📊 Results

Accuracy: ~XX% (update with your Kaggle score)

Best-performing model: (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
🔮 Future Improvements

Hyperparameter tuning

Try advanced models (XGBoost, LightGBM, Neural Nets)

Add visualization of survival probabilities

Deploy as a simple web app using Flask or Streamlit
